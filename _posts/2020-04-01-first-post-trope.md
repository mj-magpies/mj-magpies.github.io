I originally intended this as a mild little tech blog to document going back to school in my mid-thirties for a Computer Science degree, with some minor thoughts on The Industry.

Having a fondness for historians, particularly of the 'life goes on and people have always been people' variety, this will likely become something of a plague diary for posterity.
